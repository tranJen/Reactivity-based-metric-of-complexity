# Reactivity-based-metric-of-complexity

Suong Tran's series of Jupyter notebooks for complexity project in Masha lab. 

##### Current goal: Generate working data set of single reduction of ketone to alcohol
---
What have been done so far:

- Finish retrieving data set of hydride reduction of cyclo5,6ketone. 
  - Acquire data set from Reaxys (navigate general cleaning for how to reproduce data set)
  - Step 1: General cleaning
  - Step 2: Verify single reduction by changing in molecular weight (MW) of reaction
  - Step 3: Verify single reduction by changing in carbon-oxygen bond of reaction
  - Step 4: Filter for consistent reaction conditions
  - Step 5: Inspect duplicate rows
  - Step 6: Manually check
  
- Generalize the steps above for other data set

Next step: 

- Propose reactions from finished data set to test and 'negative' reactions
- Retreive more data set for ketone in larger ring and chain
