# Reactivity-based-metric-of-complexity

Suong Tran's series of Jupyter notebooks for complexity project in Masha lab. 

##### Current goal: Generate working data set of single reduction of ketone to alcohol
---
What have been doen so far:
- Acquire data set from Reaxys (navigate general cleaning for how to reproduce data set)
- Step 1: General cleaning
- Step 2: Verify single reduction by changing in molecular weight (MW) of reaction
- Step 3: Verify single reduction by changing in carbon-oxygen bond of reaction

Next step: Filter same reaction conditions.
