# Reactivity-based-metric-of-complexity

Suong Tran's series of Jupyter notebooks for complexity project in Masha lab. 

##### Current goal: Extracting features, Calculating published metrics and analyzing their correlation with the yield
---
- What have been done so far:

  Generate working data set of single reduction of ketone to alcohol
  - Acquire data set from Reaxys (navigate general cleaning for how to reproduce data set)
  - Step 1: General cleaning
  - Step 2: Verify single reduction by changing in molecular weight (MW) of reaction
  - Step 3: Verify single reduction by changing in carbon-oxygen bond of reaction
  - Step 4: Filter for consistent reaction conditions
  - Step 5: Inspect duplicate rows
  - Step 6: Manually verify the reaction

- Next step:
  - Extracting basic features
  - Calculating published metrics
  - Analyzing their correlation with the yield
